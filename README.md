# Random-PW-Generator

# This is is able to make passwords between 8-128 characters

# I was able to create the prompts but was unable to figure out how to get it to only use selectred characters. 

# I know this has something to do with conditional statements but I cant figure out how to write it.

# So as it stands this currently uses all characters, including numbers letters, and special symbols
